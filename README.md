## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Instant Floor Plan Generation**: Create professional architectural floor plans with a simple text prompt
- **Customizable Designs**: Specify room numbers, types, and design preferences
- **Professional Output**: Generate industry-standard floor plans ready for further development
- **User-Friendly API**: Seamlessly integrate our technology into existing workflows

## üß† How It Works

ArchiTech uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model to transform text descriptions into detailed architectural floor plans. Our backend processes these requests through a robust Django API, delivering high-quality results in seconds.
